### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with passion for React, Redux, Javascript, and Python. Through App Academy's rigorous 24-week, 1000+ hrs bootcamp, I have gained the multitude of skills needed to become not just an effective software engineer, but also a communicative team member who can strive to improve the company.  

As a full stack software developer, I have enjoyed using Javascript, React, Redux, Python, Express, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Sequelize, HTML, CSS, and PostgreSQL. I am currently learning how to utilize sockets in my applications for live chats. I am always looking for ways to improve both my applications and myself as much as I can!  

On a more personal note, I absolutely adore sports- specifically, basketball, football, and most recently, Formula 1 Racing. Being from Southern California, I grew up watching the late, great, and iconic Kobe Bryant don the purple and gold for the city of LA. Watching the Lakers with my dad and brothers was one of the highlights of my childhood. Formula 1 recently became a passion of mine after a friend introduced me to the sport. Watching the high stakes driving and the extremely competitive nature of the drivers is phenomenal and very exciting.
